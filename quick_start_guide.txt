In this directory, there are four folders.

-- RO 
------ This folder contains the design of 450 ring oscillator pairs.

-- TRNG 
------ This folder contains the design of a multiple RO TRNG. 

-- system
------ This folder has the hardware LPN-core

-- LPN_PUF_complete_test
------ Open Vivado, enter tcl directory, enter command "source
dma_ex_interrupt.tcl" in the console. The project will be created and built. 

-- SW
------ It contains all the software code.  

How to use this? 
1. Package ro_pair.v as one IP core for ZedBoard. 
2. Package all the Verilog files in TRNG folder as one IP core for ZedBoard. 
3. Package all the Verilog files in system folder as one IP core for ZedBoard. 
4. Change the directory of these three IP cores in \LPN_PUF_complete_test\tcl\bd_zedboard.tcl  (Search the keyword "Notice")
5. Update your pin selection in \LPN_PUF_complete_test\tcl\my_xdc.xdc. Notice
that currently switch 0 on ZedBoard is used for selecting the mode Gen (0) or
Ver (1). Switch 1 is used to start the hardware to run.
6. Open Vivado, enter the tcl folder. Run "source dma_ex_interrupt.tcl"
7. After this, you will have a post implementation design. Open SDK, import
the hardware design. 
8. Create a new SW project in SDK, and import all the code in SW to your
project. 
9. Set the heap/stack size to 64MB. 
10. Compile the code and program the FPGA. 
11. See the output from a UART terminal with Baud rate 115200. Do not forget
to push switch 0 to select mode, and push switch 1 to start one Gen/Ver
operation.
